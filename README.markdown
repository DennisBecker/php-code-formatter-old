PHP_CodeFormatter
=================
PHP_CodeFormatter has been started due to the fact that PHP_Beautifier is
extremly ugly to extend for your own coding standard. Other solutions like
PHP_CodeBeautifier are even more worse. That's why I intend to recreate a nice
code formatting tool which will make use of more modern PHP OOP.
