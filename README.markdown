PHP_CodeFormatter
=================
PHP_CodeFormatter has been started due to the fact that PHP_Beautifier is
extremly ugly to extend for your own coding standard. Other solutions like
PHP_CodeBeautifier are even more worse. That's why I intend to recreate a nice
code formatting tool which will make use of more modern PHP OOP.

Planned Releases
----------------
1. 0.1 Beta will have support for PEAR Coding Standard
2. 0.2 Beta change to more OOP and write unit tests
3. 0.3 beta will be a refactoring after analyzes with xhprof


Version 1.0 will be released after beta phase

Release Blockers for 0.1 Beta
