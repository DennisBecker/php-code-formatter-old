# PHP_CodeFormatter restart
I will restart this project in a few weeks under https://github.com/DennisBecker/php-code-formatter due to
the fact that I want to completely remove the old commits from the history. This project started as a prototype.
With the lessons learned, I will create a code formatting tool which will use the decorator pattern for applying
formatting rules to the tokens. More details will come in the new repository.

# PHP_CodeFormatter
PHP_CodeFormatter has been started due to the fact that PHP_Beautifier is
extremly ugly to extend for your own coding standard. Other solutions like
PHP_CodeBeautifier are even more worse. That's why I intend to recreate a nice
code formatting tool which will make use of more modern PHP OOP. This is just a
protoype which helps me to find solutions for some problems you have with command
line PHP tools.
